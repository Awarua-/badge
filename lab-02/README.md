## Microcontrollers
This lab will teach the basics of constructing a circuit which includes a microcontroller.

Microcontrollers are cheap devices which allow you to introduce programmable behaviour to a system. This can be used for pretty much anything you can imagine, from simply telling a LED to blink, to controlling the lights in your home, and even to creating a conference badge of blinky LEDs. Of course, you can do more than turning lights on and off, too ;)

The badge uses the relatively simple and inexpensive Atmel AVR Attiny13A chip. The Attiny family of microcontrollers includes a range of minimal very low power devices which are great for small projects. Other common microcontrollers you may come across include the Atmel Atmega range, commonly used in Arduino devices.

| Breadboard                        |     x1 |
| LED                               |     x2 |
| 100 Ohm resister                  |     x2 |
| Button battery holder             |     x1 |
| Button battery (CR2025 or CR2032) |     x1 |
| Jumper wires                      |     x3 |

### Instructions
1. Assemble the components into a circuit based on the following diagram:
*TODO: Insert diagram*
2. Once all is connected, insert the battery into the battery holder. Make sure the flat side with writing is up.
3. All going well, the preprogrammed microcontroller should alternately flash both LEDs.
