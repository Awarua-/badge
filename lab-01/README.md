## Electrical Circuits

In the first part of the course, we are going to learn a bit about the laws which govern how electricity behaves and about the components we will utilise to put it to work.

Electrical circuits are all about electrons (the ‘charge’) flowing through a conductive path (the 'current') from a low potential area to a high potential area (the ‘voltage’). There are many components we can use to modify how that charge flows, including interrupting it (‘switches’), limiting it (‘resistors’), storing it (‘capacitors’), and transforming its energy to another form (‘LEDs’).

The key equation to learn which governs how this charge moves is:
```voltage = current * resistance (V = IR)```

In the first lab, we will use a battery (changing chemical energy to potential energy) and some simple components to create some simple circuit and measure the differences in voltage and current at various points and learn the differences in between series and parallel circuits.

### Instructions

1. Using your breadboard as the base, create the following circuit.

2. Put the multimeter into `Voltage - DC` mode and measure the voltage across various components (touch each leg).
3. Add the second resistor to the circuit in series (i.e. one after the other in a circuit) as per the diagram below. Observe the changes in the LED brightness and use the multimeter to measure the differing voltage drops.

4. Add the second resistor to the circuit in parallel (i.e. both starting at the same point and finishing at the same point). Observe the changes in the LED brightness and use the multimeter to measure the differing voltage drops.
