## Soldering
Now you have built some circuits using a breadboard, lets learn how to make something more permanent using solder to weld components together.

Soldering is a key skill when working with electronics. However, the only way to become skilled at soldering is to practice!

*Note:*

+ *Soldering irons are hot! Always be aware of where you soldering iron is, especially the tip. Never lay it on the table, always put it back in the holder.*
+ *Solder and solder flux creates fumes which may irritate. Alway solder in a well ventilated area.*
+ *Solder contains lead (Pb), a toxic substance. Do not ingest it! Wash your hands after soldering and make sure you do not hold components in your mouth to prevent this!*

### Instructions
1. Plug in your soldering iron, set it to 325 degrees, and place it on the cradle to warm up. Make sure you are always aware of you iron and its cable!
2. Prep your first item to solder. Insert each leg of a resistor through a hole on the perfboard, then bend the wires away from the component, which will hold it in place, like the image below (well not exaclty, I forgot to take a pic using a perfboard, so I used a badge example instead):

3. Place the perfboard on the table or stick it in some bluetac to hold it in place.
4. Test your soldering irons temperature by gently touching the end of the solder to the iron, about 1-2mm back from the tip. This is the hottest part of the iron, not the tip. If the solder melts, you're good to go. This is called "tinning" the iron. Wipe off the excess solder using the brass sponge.
5. Gently press the side of your soldering iron, about 1-2mm back from the tip, against the leg of the resistor, also touching the metal pad of the perfboard hole. Let both heat up for a couple of seconds, then gently touch the end of the solder to the soldering iron near where it touches the component. Refer to [this video](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/kiwicon-badge/badge/master/lab-04/images/soldering.mov) for an example.
6. The solder wire should melt and wick into the gap between the resistor and the perfboard. When it does, pull away the solderfirst, then the iron.
7. Et voila! You've made your first solder joint.

Once you have done a bunch, give me a yell to come check out your handy work.

*Note:
+ You are not trying to wipe solder from the iron onto the components. You should instead heat the components up and let capilliary action work its magic. As long as everything is up to temperature, solder will quickly wick into the joint.
+ Use the side of the tip (aka the sweet spot), not the very tip of the iron. This is the hottest part and works the best to quickly get the components up to temperature. That said, if you need to get into a tight spot or are doing SMD work on small traces, use the tip,.
+ Aim to heat both the pad and the part you want to solder evenly and at the same time. Be aware that larger components will take more heat, so you will have to press the iron against those first before also touching the pad.
+ Regularly tin your soldering iron and clean it off in the brass sponge. A clean tip works much better than a dirty one!*
