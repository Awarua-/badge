# Kiwicon Intro to Badge Hacking

This repo is to host the instructions and code for the Kiwicon 2038 Intro to Badge Hacking course (https://www.kiwicon.org/the-con/training/intro-to-badge-hacking/).

## Electrical Circuits
In the first part of the course, we are going to learn a bit about the laws which govern how electricity behaves and about the components we will utilise to put it to work.

### Instructions
Electrical circuits are all about electrons (the ‘charge’) flowing through a conductive path (the 'current') from a low potential area to a high potential area (the ‘voltage’). There are many components we can use to modify how that charge flows, including interrupting it (‘switches’), limiting it (‘resistors’), storing it (‘capacitors’), and transforming its energy to another form (‘LEDs’).

In this first lab, we will create a circuit using a battery to create a diffence in potential, using chemical energy to create electrical energy. We will then use a few basic components to create our variations of a simple circuit and measure the differences in voltage and current, and note the changes to the light produced by the LED.

## Soldering
Now you have built a circuit, lets learn how to make something more permanent using soldering.

*Note:*

+ *Soldering irons are hot! Always be aware of where you soldering iron is, especially the tip. Never lay it on the table, always put it back in the holder.*
+ *Solder and solder flux creates fumes which may irritate. Alway solder in a well ventilated area.*
+ *Solder contains lead (Pb), a toxic substance. Do not ingest it! Wash your hands after soldering and make sure you do not hold components in your mouth to prevent this!*
