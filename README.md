# Kiwicon Intro to Badge Hacking

This repo is to host the instructions and code for the Kiwicon 2038 Intro to Badge Hacking course (https://www.kiwicon.org/the-con/training/intro-to-badge-hacking/).

## Electrical Circuits
In the first part of the course, we are going to learn a bit about the laws which govern how electricity behaves and about the components we will utilise to put it to work.

Electrical circuits are all about electrons (the ‘charge’) flowing through a conductive path from a low potential area to a high potential area (the ‘current’).  There are many components we can use to modify how that charge flows, including interrupting it (‘switches’), limiting it (‘resistors’), storing it (‘capacitors’), and transforming its energy to another form (‘LEDs’).
